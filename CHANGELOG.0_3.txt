OpenStore 0.3 changes from 0.2

I've been working a lot on the train, which means that there are a couple of mondo check-ins to CVS of the things that I have been fixing and updating. 
I have fixed bugs as I have found them, and the major change is the addition of discount coupons. This is a special code that users can enter which gives them a discount on the price of their products, You can add and remove these coupons from the admin pages. The demonstration site has one coupon built in to the database scripts using the code 'discount'.

I have added a date widget to the HTTPUtil. You can now create date inputs from a unix timestamp, and read them back in to a unix timestamp when the page is submitted. This is used to set the start and end dates for discount coupons. 

Upgrading from OpenStore 0.2 to 0.3 will require a small database migration. The script to run is openstore/Database/migrate/0.2To0.3.sql.
If you can it would be better to just use the OpenStore 0.3 database from scratch as I forgot to name the foreign key constraints in 0.2.

* Updated todo 1045957 product groupings
